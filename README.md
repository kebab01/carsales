# carsales
A python script that reads a [carales](https://www.carsales.com.au/) webpage and scrapes the data about the cars and puts the data into an excel doc so you can find the best priced car. Please note this script is quite old and has been superseded by a mobile app version, with full webscraping capability. Please check [here](https://github.com/kebab01/carsales-scraper) for more information.

## Usage
- Save the webpages you want to scrape into a directory called CarsalesFiles - Had to be done this way as I wasnt able to get around the anti-web scraping technology implemented on carsales website
- Run the script using `python scrape.py`
- Script will populate excel spreadsheet
